# Contributing to the Global Reports project

Basically just follow the current theme of how things are structured and you'll be fine. Doesn't have to be perfect, every contribution matters and mistakes can be corrected :)

For any questions, thoughts, ideas, issues, etc, use the [Issues](https://github.com/andressoop/global-reports/issues) page like a forum to start a discussion.

## Reports to include
> To narrow down the scope
- Reports published by international organisations that cover global scale
- Excerpts and specials, directly related to the main report covering global scale
- Reports published with a minimum of yearly intervals
- Different languages of the same report

## Reports not to include
> So the project wont get too big. For now.
- Summaries
- Excerpts and specials that **do not** cover global scale
- Regional reports `up for discussion if we should include them in the future`
- Country reports
- Reports published more than one time a year

## Layout
> To keep everything unified and in an orderly fashion.
- List reports alphabetical
- If possible, link directly to the PDF, if not, then the most specific page of the report where it can be viewed or downloaded
- Different languages of the same report should be added in the end of the name in this fashion: **[ar, fr, zh]** - [use ISO 639-1 two-letter codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
- If in a specific year no report was published, mark it in this fashion: **2015 n/a**
- If the report has been published, but there is no publication of it online, leave the name of the report without the link. Same goes for languages
- Indent related reports under the main report 
- Use ` â€“ ` symbol for resource title and subtitle separation with spaces both sides and `: ` for further name separation with no spaces in the left side
- Add ` $ ` symbol to the end of resource name if the report is not free

# Contributing to the Global Reports project

Basically, just follow the current theme of how things are structured and you'll be fine. Doesn't have to be perfect, every contribution matters and mistakes can be corrected :)

For any questions, thoughts, ideas, issues, etc, use the [issues](https://github.com/andressoop/global-reports/issues) page to start a discussion.



## Ways to contribute
> To get started

- Add new reports
- Add new releases to the existing reports
- Track down missing links
- Fix broken links
- Take a look at [open issues](https://github.com/andressoop/global-reports/issues) for things to do
- Post new ideas on how to improve the list to the [issues](https://github.com/andressoop/global-reports/issues) page 



## Reports to include
> To narrow down the scope

- Reports published by international organisations that cover global scale
- Excerpts and specials, directly related to the main report covering global scale
- Reports published with a minimum of yearly intervals
- English version of the report



## Reports not to include
> So the list won't get too big. For now.

- Excerpts and specials that **do not** cover global scale
- Regional reports
- Country reports
- Reports published more than one time a year



## Layout
> To keep everything in an orderly fashion.

```
  ## Name of the Report
  > Name of the organisation ([source](link to the list of these reports))
  
  - YEAR Name of the Report – Name of this particular report if it has one ([full](link to the pdf of the full report), [summary](link to the pdf of the summary), [web](link to the report's website where further information could be found))
```

- List reports alphabetical
- [full] should link directly to the pdf version of the report
- [summary] should link directly to the pdf version of the report's summary
- [web] should link to the reports specific web page where you find more information and resources
- If in a specific year no report was published, but should have been, mark it in this fashion: **2015 n/a**
- If the report has been published, but there is no publication of it online, leave the name of the report without any links
- Indent related reports under the main report 
- Use **Title Case** for the reports main title and **Sentence case** for subtitle and everything else that follows
- Use en dash ` – ` for resource title and subtitle separation, `: ` for further name separation
- Add ` $ ` to the end of resource line if the report is not free
- Don't forget Table of Contents
